# Calculator Web App

A simple **calculator web application** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, and **modulus** (remainder of division). The app also allows users to input numbers and operations directly from the keyboard.

## Features

- **Supported operations**:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Modulus (remainder, %)
  
- **Keyboard Support**:
  - You can use the keyboard to enter numbers and operations directly into the calculator.
  - The **Esc** key corresponds to the **C** button (for clear).
  - The **Enter** key or **=** executes the calculation (equivalent to the equals button).

- **"Back" button**: A simple navigation button to return to the previous page (if included in a larger interface).
